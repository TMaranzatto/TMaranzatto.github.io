I'm a postdoctoral researcher at University of Maryland. I find myself working on problems at the intersection of graph theory, information theory, and learning algorithms. I'm currently working on projects involving LLM token dynamics, gossiping networks, and private information retrieval.


My current appointment is in [Sennur Ulukus's](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~ulukus/) lab in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. I recieved my PhD in Mathematics from University of Illinois Chicago in 2024, advised by [Lev Reyzin](https://www.levreyzin.com/). 

**Thomas vs. Jake**: My legal name is Thomas and I use this as my primary identifier in my papers.  However in social settings I go by my middle name Jacob/ Jake.
