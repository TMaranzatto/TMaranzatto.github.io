I'm a postdoctoral researcher at University of Maryland. I'm mentored by [Sennur Ulukus](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~ulukus/) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. I recieved my PhD in Mathematics from University of Illinois Chicago in 2024, advised by [Lev Reyzin](https://www.levreyzin.com/). I find myself working on problems at the intersection of graph theory, information theory, and learning algorithms. I'm currently working on projects involving LLM token dynamics, gossiping networks, and private information retrieval.
